## 🚀 About Me - The Journey

Since childhood I wanted to be an inventor. Today, I've found my true vocation in software development where I can 'invent' digital solutions that solve real-world problems. My varied background gives me a unique perspective and strong problem-solving skills.

Currently pursuing my education at **42 Academy**, where I'm learning not just to code but to think like a developer through peer-to-peer collaboration and project-based learning.
