## 🚀 About Me - The Journey

Since childhood I've to be an **inventor**. Today, I've found my calling in software development where I can 'invent' digital solutions that solve real-world problems. This discovery has transformed from curiosity into genuine passion.

After diverse professional experiences, I've found my true vocation in programming. My varied background gives me a unique perspective and strong problem-solving skills that I bring to software development.

Currently pursuing my education at **42 Academy**, where I'm learning not just to code, but to think like a developer through peer-to-peer collaboration and project-based learning.
